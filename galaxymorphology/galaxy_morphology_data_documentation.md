# Data Types
Data for this AI/ML training dataset is made available in a mix of the Flexible Image Transport System (otherwise known as ['.fits' data](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/) ) format used in astrophysics and JSON. FITS is an open data standard and tools for reading .fits files are supported by the astropy package in Python, but a list of known packages which support accessing .fits data is centralized on the [standard's website](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_libraries.html).

Data for this training dataset is paired: each pair consists of a FITS image and a JSON label with the positions and object type labels for galaxies of a known morphological type. The JSON files include both the centers of the galaxies and a bounding box width and height, as well as the positions of the lower left corner, such that the training set labels can by used by a number of object detection models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) or Fast R-CNN. The naming convention for these files is *\<fieldname\>_col\<number\>_row\<number\>* where the two corresponding files are *\<fieldname\>_col\<number\>_row\<number\>.fits* and *\<fieldname\>_col\<number\>_row\<number\>.json*

# Data origins and preprocessing

Image data for this training data set originated from the Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys and was processed by the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) [Koekemoer et al. 2011](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/197/2/36) who produced large field images from their survey and already existing data. Data in this training data set represents 5 unique filters with ACS: F606W, F775W, F814W, F125W, and F160W which are documented in the [ACS Data Analysis Handbook](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/acs/data-analysis/system-throughputs). Fields in this dataset include: the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS), the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N). Initial data for the AEGIS field with the F606W and F814W filters were obtained by the PI M. Davis and were published in [Davis et al. 2007](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/517931). Data from the COSMOS field was obtained prior to CANDELS in the F814W filter by the COSMOS survey team ([Scoville et al. 2007](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/516580/pdf)). Data in the F606W and F814W filter were obtained by the original GOODS survey and were published in [Giavalisco et al. 2004](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/379232). For each field 4 channels of data is made available.


Labels for galaxy morphologies was compiled from a Galaxy Zoo citizen science project published by [Willett et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/464/4/4176/2527878). In this citizen science project, users of the Zooniverse platform were presented with three color images constructed from available Hubble Space Telescope data and were asked a series of questions starting with answering if the object they saw was smooth, had features such as spiral arms, or was a star or artifact. The table which includes object identifiers, positions, and votes from citizen scientists associated with the Willett et al. 2017 publication is found at [https://data.galaxyzoo.org/](https://data.galaxyzoo.org/). Based on results from this table, labels have been generated algorithmically for galaxies in the images based on standard astronomy nomenclature and examples in Galaxy Zoo publications:

* __edge-on__ label: was applied when at least 10 people inspected the image and where at least 50% of citizen scientists agreed it had features or a disk, and 50% also agreed with was not clumpy and 60% of citizen scientists agreed it looked edge on
* __elliptical__ label:  was applied when at least 10 people inpsected the image and where at least 60% of citizen scientists agreed it appeared smooth with no features and either 60% of citizen scientists agreed it looked completely round or 60% of citizen scientists agreed it looked it looked in between completely round and cigar shaped.
* __spiral__ label: was applied when at least 10 people inspected the image and where at least 23% of citizen scientists agreed it had features or a disk, >= 25% agreed it was not edge on, >= 25% agreed it was a spiral  and > 25% agreed there was no bar.
* __barred-spiral__ label: was applied when at least 10 people inspected the image and where at least 23% of citizen scientists agreed it had features or a disk, >= 25% agreed it was not edge on, >= 25% agreed it was a spiral  and > 30% agreed there was a central bar.
* __irregular__ label: as applied when at least 10 people inspected the image and where at least 10 people where at least 23% of the citizen scientist agreed the galaxy had features or a disk, that at least 25% agreed it appeared clumpy, less than 20% agreed the clumps were in a spiral and > 25% of citizen scientists didn't think there was anything odd such as a dust lane, a lens or arc, or a merger
